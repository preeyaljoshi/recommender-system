## Overview
The Movie Recommender System is designed to enhance the movie-watching experience by suggesting films based on user ratings and preferences. By analyzing user behavior, it identifies patterns to provide tailored recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Flask (if applicable)
- Pickle (for data storage)

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

- `Movie Recommender system.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and analysis of the recommendation system.
- `main.py`: The main script that runs the recommender system and serves recommendations.
- `movie_dict.pkl`: A serialized dictionary containing movie metadata.
- `movie_list.pkl`: A serialized list of movies used for recommendations.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the necessary Python packages for the project.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## How It Works
The system employs collaborative filtering to analyze user ratings and determine similarities among users or movies. The primary steps include:
1. **Data Loading**: Load movie data and user ratings from the pickle files.
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Use algorithms like cosine similarity to identify similar users or items.
3. **Recommendation Generation**: Generate a list of recommended movies based on user preferences and the similarities identified.

## Features
- User-friendly interface (if using Flask)
- Personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings
- Ability to view popular or trending movies
- Easy integration with other systems or platforms

## Installation
To set up the Movie Recommender System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender.git
   cd movie-recommender
